# DALL.E
### What is Dall.E
DALLE 2 is a text-to-image AI system, or a CLIP system (connecting text to images). It is an encoder-decoder model, meaning when text is given, this text is encoded into a machine input, processed by the machine, and then fed through a decoder that decodes this into a visible image. In the Image below, this is the bottom pathway.
### Wny We Use Dall.E
DALL-E (stylized as DALL. E) and DALL-E 2 are deep learning models developed by OpenAI to generate digital images from natural language descriptions, called "prompts". DALL-E was revealed by OpenAI in a blog post in January 2021, and uses a version of GPT-3 modified to generate images.
